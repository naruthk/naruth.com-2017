## Website
This repository contains the necessary files that are used to edit, compile, and build my personal website, which is hosted on the University of Washington's cloud server.

## Install
Do Git clone, and assumming you already have NPM installed, run the following command once you're inside the current repository's directory: `npm install`

Make sure to run `gulp copy` once to output a "dist" folder that contains the required files to upload to web server. 

Make sure to then run 'gulp watch' to start production mode (using browsersync).

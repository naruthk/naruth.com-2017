## CodePen Version

I've recently decided to distribute a front-end HTML + CSS + Javascript version of my website for those who might be interested in it. I personally like the overall design and development of my own website. It feels really great to be able to come up with my own design (with inspiration from other people, of course) and to be able to share it with other developers out there.

Here's the link: **working on it**
